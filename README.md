# Cointegration Analysis in Financial Time Series

In financial markets, it's common to observe relationships between time series data that may appear correlated in the short term but lack a meaningful long-term connection. These apparent correlations, known as spurious correlations, can lead to misleading conclusions and ineffective trading strategies. To distinguish between spurious correlations and genuine long-term relationships, we employ the concept of cointegration and the Engle-Granger two-step method.

Cointegration allows us to identify pairs of non-stationary time series that exhibit a stable long-term relationship, even though they may individually drift apart in the short run. The Engle-Granger method provides a framework for testing cointegration, involving regression and residual analysis.


## Introduction

In financial markets, it is common to observe correlations between time series data that may appear significant in the short term but lack meaningful long-term connections. These apparent correlations, known as spurious correlations, can mislead analysts and traders into forming ineffective strategies. Spurious relationships arise when two or more non-stationary time series seem correlated purely by chance, often due to common trends or cycles rather than a true underlying relationship. Recognizing and distinguishing these spurious correlations is crucial for accurate financial analysis.

Both of them appear to be correlated, but are they really?

## Cointegration

Cointegration is a statistical property of time series variables that allows us to identify pairs (or groups) of non-stationary series that move together over the long term. Even if the individual time series exhibit random walks or trends, a cointegrated relationship implies that they maintain a stable equilibrium relationship over time. This concept is essential for financial applications, as it suggests that despite short-term fluctuations, certain asset prices have a predictable long-term relationship, which can be exploited in trading strategies.

## Engle-Granger Two-Step Method

The Engle-Granger two-step method is a widely used approach for testing cointegration between two non-stationary time series. 

1. **Step 1**: A linear regression is performed on the two time series to estimate their relationship. The residuals from this regression capture the deviation from the estimated equilibrium relationship.

2. **Step 2**: The residuals are then tested for stationarity using tests such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. If the residuals are found to be stationary, it suggests that the original series are cointegrated, indicating a long-term relationship between them.

This method provides a robust framework for identifying meaningful relationships in financial data, thereby allowing for more informed decision-making in trading strategies.

## Project Overview

This project investigates the concept of cointegration in financial time series data, focusing on identifying stable long-term relationships between pairs of stocks. The analysis utilizes historical price data sourced from Yahoo Finance through the `yfinance` library, allowing for a comprehensive examination of stock behavior over time.

### Data Collection
Historical stock price data is obtained using the `yfinance` library, which allows for easy access to a wide range of financial data directly from Yahoo Finance.

### Methodology
- **Engle-Granger Two-Step Method**: The project implements the Engle-Granger two-step method for testing cointegration using `statsmodels` library for statistical modeling and conducting regression analysis and hypothesis tests we also used `matplotlib` For visualizing data and results.
